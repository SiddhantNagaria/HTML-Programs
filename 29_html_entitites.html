    HTML Character Entities
    Some characters are reserved in HTML.
    If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.
    Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
    To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
    To display a greater than sign (>) we must write: &gt; or &#62;
    Non-breaking Space
A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line).
